# PRODIGY_CS_01
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. For encryption, you shift each letter by a certain number (key), while for decryption, you shift in the opposite direction to retrieve the original message. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
